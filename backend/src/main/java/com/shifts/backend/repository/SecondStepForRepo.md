In order to solely test the controllers, I am using fake repositories.
The repository folder will be filed with DTO objects. their jobs will be converting relational table data into objects that will follow the calendar, employee shift and timeblock model structures.
TODO: Create classes that will connect to the database
TODO: have the classes use methods that will convert the data into calendar, employee shift and timeblock objects
TODO:Connect them to the controllers
TODO: Create methods that will convert the objects into relational table data
